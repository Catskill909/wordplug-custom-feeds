# MDC Web Assets

Place MDC Web (Material Components for the Web) CSS and JS files here. You can download the official build from https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/releases or use npm/yarn to build your own.

For development/testing, link to CDN in your admin enqueue code if you prefer not to bundle files locally.
